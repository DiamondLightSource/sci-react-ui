  <h1>Scientific design system for Diamond</h1>
  <p><strong>Version: Scientific React UI - v0.3.1-alpha.3</strong></p>

{" "}
<p>
  Diamond II brings major upgrades to our scientific capabilities, and with that
  comes a growing ecosystem of tools used across beamlines, data acquisition,
  analysis, and scientific support.
</p>

{" "}
<p>
  This design system gives us a shared foundation of components, patterns, and
  visual rules so that every tool at Diamond feels coherent, predictable, and
  efficient, in service of better science and smoother operations across the
  facility.
</p>

{" "}
<h2>Why we need a design system</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Modernise for Diamond II</strong>: redesign interfaces with clarity,
    safety, and efficiency at the core.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Unify legacy systems</strong>: reduce inconsistent patterns,
    behaviours, and visual languages across tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduce cognitive load</strong>: scientists and engineers move
    between multiple systems; familiarity helps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accelerate delivery</strong>: shared components and patterns reduce
    repeated work.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Future-proof</strong>: new tools start coherent and stay coherent.
  </li>
</ul>

{" "}
<h2>What the design system includes</h2>
<h3>Design assets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Foundations</strong>: colour, typography, spacing, grid, interaction
    states
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Components</strong>: buttons, inputs, tables, tabs
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Patterns</strong>: panels, configuration, monitoring, data browsing
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Templates</strong>: pages, dashboards, details views
  </li>
</ul>

{" "}
<h3>Plus</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Accessibility guidance</li>
  <li>Processes and documentation</li>
  <li>UX strategy and interaction principles</li>
</ul>

{" "}
<h2>Where truth lives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Figma</strong> is the design source of truth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storybook</strong> is the code source of truth.
  </li>
  <li>
    We build on <strong>Material UI (MUI)</strong> in React, customised for
    Diamond workflows.
  </li>
</ul>

{" "}
<h2>What’s different about scientific controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Time is scarce</strong> on beamlines; interruptions are costly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Experiments are stateful</strong>; the UI must make state and
    progress obvious.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Users may be visiting</strong> and working under pressure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>High-density data</strong> is normal: tables, logs, dashboards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Safety-critical actions</strong> need clear signifiers,
    confirmation, and recovery paths.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2>How to use this documentation</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with Foundations to understand the rules.</li>
    <li>Use Components for building blocks.</li>
    <li>Use Patterns for repeatable workflows.</li>
    <li>Treat docs as the shared contract: what we build, how it behaves, and why.</li>
  </ol>
