  <h1>Cognitive and learning accessibility</h1>

<p>
  Accessibility is not only about vision or motor input. People differ in how
  they process information, maintain focus, remember things, and recover from
  errors.
</p>

<p>
  In complex scientific tools, these differences matter. Our responsibility is
  to design systems that are usable, understandable, and forgiving across a wide
  range of abilities and conditions.
</p>

<h2>Experience, usability, and accessibility by design</h2>

<p>
  Improving accessibility is not just about adding new features. It also means
  continuously improving the core experience: making it more intuitive, more
  inclusive, and easier to use.
</p>

<p>
  Our users include people with different processing capabilities and
  disabilities. We should consider these differences when designing interfaces,
  interactions, and content — not as edge cases, but as part of normal usage.
</p>

<h2>User processing capabilities to consider</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reading, skimming, and scanning content</li>
  <li>Focus and sustained attention</li>
  <li>Different memory types and memorisation strategies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of disabilities and conditions</h2>
<p>Users may experience one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cognitive disabilities</li>
  <li>Learning disabilities</li>
  <li>Intellectual disability</li>
  <li>Vision impairment (including colour blindness)</li>
  <li>Deaf or hard of hearing</li>
  <li>Physical disabilities</li>
  <li>Mental health conditions</li>
  <li>Acquired brain injury</li>
  <li>Neurodiversity</li>
</ul>

{" "}

<p>
  With this in mind, usability and accessibility should be treated as
  foundational design qualities, not optional enhancements.
</p>

{" "}

<h2>Design objectives</h2>

{" "}

<p>
  The W3C guidance on cognitive and learning disabilities is useful not only for
  people with disabilities, but for most users. The objectives below are adapted
  from that guidance and reflect how we aim to design Diamond tools.
</p>

{" "}

<h3>Help users understand what things are and how to use them</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use icons, symbols, terms, and patterns that are already familiar.</li>
  <li>
    Avoid inventing new interaction patterns without strong justification.
  </li>
  <li>Make purpose and behaviour obvious at first glance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help users find what they need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use clear structure, headings, and visual boundaries.</li>
  <li>Keep navigation predictable and consistent.</li>
  <li>Use layout and grouping to signal relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use clear content</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prefer simple words and short sentences.</li>
  <li>Break text into small, readable blocks.</li>
  <li>Use clear images and diagrams where they add meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help users avoid mistakes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ask only for information that is genuinely required.</li>
  <li>Prevent errors where possible, rather than reacting to them.</li>
  <li>When errors occur, make recovery easy and explicit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help users focus</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary distractions.</li>
  <li>
    Use headings and structure to help users re-orient if context is lost.
  </li>
  <li>Provide breadcrumbs or clear navigation paths where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provide help and support</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make it easy to access human help or support.</li>
  <li>Offer multiple ways to understand content (text, visuals, summaries).</li>
  <li>Use icons and visual cues to reinforce meaning, not replace it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support adaptation and personalisation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allow users to adjust preferences when possible.</li>
  <li>Design so assistive technologies and extensions can work effectively.</li>
  <li>Avoid blocking browser or OS-level accessibility features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test with real users</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Involve people with different disabilities in research and testing.</li>
  <li>Include them in usability testing and design validation.</li>
  <li>Treat their feedback as expert input.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying this in Storybook</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Is the component understandable without prior knowledge?</li>
  <li>Does it rely on memory or hidden rules?</li>
  <li>Is error recovery clear and forgiving?</li>
  <li>Would this still make sense at the end of a long day?</li>
</ul>
